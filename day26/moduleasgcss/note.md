Dear Grader,

For this assignment, I followed your instructions closely, creating a restaurant website with four distinct pages: Home Page, Our Menu Page, Contact Us Page, and About Us Page. The HTML and CSS have been structured to meet the specified requirements.

In response to your request, I've provided inline CSS for each section, though it's essential to emphasize that this approach might not be ideal for larger websites. For scalability and maintainability in real-world scenarios, it's recommended to use external CSS files.

Please note that I've used placeholder image URLs and form action for demonstration purposes. In a real project, these should be replaced with actual content and proper backend handling.

Thank you for reviewing my assignment!

Best regards,
Aniket Parmar
